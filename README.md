How This Enhances the User Experience

    Accessibility: The checkbox-based interface eliminates the need to remember specific slash commands or syntax, making it accessible for players of all skill levels.

    Ease of Use: Adjusting settings becomes as simple as ticking or unticking a box, with changes applied immediately, saving time compared to navigating through Blizzard's menu system or typing commands.

    Convenience: The addon centralizes all related options into one place, avoiding the need to search through the Blizzard interface, which can feel scattered or unintuitive.

    Customization Without Hassle: Players can toggle specific aspects of name visibility quickly, tailoring the game to their preferences during gameplay without disrupting their flow.

Why It's Better Than Blizzard's Default Slash Commands

    No Typing Required: Players donâ€™t need to recall or type commands during gameplay.
    Visual Feedback: Seeing the checkbox state provides a clear and immediate understanding of the current setting.
    Centralization: All options are grouped together in one panel, rather than requiring multiple commands or menu navigation.
    User-Friendly Design: Particularly helpful for players who are less tech-savvy or those who value efficiency and convenience.
